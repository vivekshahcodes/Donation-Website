                        Giving is the greatest act of grace. It is not just about making a donation, it is about making a difference. 6.9% of the total population in India lives below the national poverty line. Animals around the world are shelterless, mistreated and ignored by everyone. Poor and homeless people are being looked down upon. Medically unfit and disabled people spend their whole life without happiness. We need to change this.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead" style="max-width: 400px;">
                        We are a group of people who want to change the world. We believe that happiness doesn't result from what we get, but from what we give. Our team is divided into sections, each representing different fields. Our goal is to start small, and expand the reach of this website and our foundation as much as possible, helping as many people as possible, and making the world a better place to live.

                    <p class="lead" style="max-width: 400px;">
                        All the donation amount will go to the charities concerned with different recipients, some of
                        which include animal welfare, orphanage, financially weak or homeless people and people with
                        disabilities.

                        The amount received will be equally divided into parts to be donated to each charity. We believe
                        in the concept of payback, the more you give, the more you will receive.
